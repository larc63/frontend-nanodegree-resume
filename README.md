# Resume Builder

## Usage

1. Modify the xmind file found in master
2. Run the python script that parses it (names and directories are hardcoded at the time of this writing)
3. Copy the json output into the js/resumeData.js file as data2
4. Open the index2.html page to see the results.

## Next steps

- [ ] Automate xmind export
- [ ] Remove old style resume builder
- [ ] Add parsing for markers so that items can be included via adding markers on xmind instead of moving them to "repositories"
